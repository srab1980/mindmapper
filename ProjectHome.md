We're going to implement a simple Mindmapping Application for the Netbeans Platform, which may be extended to support collaborative editing.
Our milestones are:

  * Design an API for the creation and management of Mindmaps
  * Implement the API for Mindmaps
  * Create Modules to manipulate Mindmaps via standard TreeView widgets
  * Create a GUI to display and edit the mindmaps using the Visual Library Framework
  * Optional: Add a second implementation of the API to support colaborative editing
